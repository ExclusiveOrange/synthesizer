maybe add some more combined instructions

already have addprod and muladd

maybe sineadd, sinemul, sinemuladd, sineaddprod, or whatever

might need to carefully consider how these are named

do the same for other types of waves

lots of extra instructions, but should help performance significantly


also:

maybe add support for a custom wave, which could be cached in a lookup table, since that worked
so well in sintable.

unsure whether to make that in a different language, or somehow integrate it into this one:

for example, add extra registers w0..w7 or however many, that are accepted in place of the r0..7 registers.
unlike those registers, however, the duration would only range from [0..1)
frequency parameters would have to change to accomodate: hertz doesn't make sense anymore, so instead
it could perhaps be cycles per [0..1)
so to make just one whole sine wave in a w register:

0, 1;
sine w0, 1, 1, 0;

and that's it.

Using w registers as input:

wave reg dest, wreg input, scalar mag, reg/scalar freq, reg/scalar phase
^ this poses a problem, though: too many parameters to an instruction (see "source instructions.txt")
^ it might be practical to omit the phase parameter...
